# Interpreter
Lox interpreter constructed alongside Robert Nystrom's "Crafting Interpreters"

Almost all of the code written for this project was copied from Robert Nystrom's "Crafting Interpreters", a book meant to teach aspiring programmers how to, well, 
craft interpreters. For me, this was mostly a practical way to learn about the fundamentals of C, memory management, and interpreters; ALL CREDIT GOES TO MR. NYSTROM
FOR THE CODE ITSELF
